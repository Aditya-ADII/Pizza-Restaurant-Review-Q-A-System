# Pizza-Restaurant-Review-Q-A-System
This project uses LangChain, Ollama, and Chroma to answer questions about pizza restaurants based on reviews in realistic_restaurant_reviews.csv. It leverages CUDA, cuDNN, and PyTorch for GPU acceleration (tested on RTX 3060, 12 GB VRAM) and monitors GPU usage with pynvml in Monitor_cuda.py.
